                    <h2>Expectations</h2>
                    <p>
                        For this project we had the motivation to do something that met our expectations.
                        We wanted to have a deep and meaningful lore, an original weapon design with interesting dynamics
                        and a distinctive and characteristic artwork of the specifications we were asked for but with a personal touch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We started the course with an engine that was quite difficult to work with and that meant that we had to restructure
                        many of the ideas we had in mind. Above all, we had to keep in mind the times and days we needed to work on each facet that we had to work on.

                <p>
                    For the final result we could summarise it in the following points:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1rem; color: #555;">
                    <li>Acceptable engine, with many applications and even if it has bugs it has been a lot of work to be able to make the game.</li>
                    <li>A design adapted to the needs and limitations of the engine.</li>
                    <li>
                        The art has been one of the most rigorous of all the departments, as we had a great quality in the models with the need to be as simple as possible. As well as a dynamic environment and very different between them.
