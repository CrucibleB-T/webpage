                    <h2>Dieno Zachael</h2>
                    <p>
                        After the fateful events which occurred during the Devastation of Baal, Dieno Zachael,
                        a Neophyte of the Flesh Tearers, was inducted to become a Primaris Marine and its notable
                        battle efforts caught the attention of the Inquisition, resulting in a nomination to the lines of the Deathwatch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A towering, silent man, built and designed for brute strength and ruthless efficiency,
                        Dieno exceeded his objectives with his new brothers while plagued by the Black Rage –reliving the death of Primarch Sanguinius–,
                        fighting innumerable xenos and deepening his knowledge in the art of war, weapons and bloodshed. After two full tours,
                        the Adeptus Ministorum ordered him to return to his original chapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, assigned with a recovery mission, Dieno must fight the Tyranids and discover the whereabouts of The Butcher of Truth,
                        a ship which has crashed on the planet Sacrarium Mortis, infested with Tyranids.

                    <p>
                        The first line of the Tyranid Hordes, armed with the Scything Claws and Fleshborer bioforms, hold their power in numbers
                        and serve as a living wall to allow stronger units to advance.

                    <p>
                        Fearsome adaptable fighters, surpassing even Space Marines in height, armed with Bone Swords and Deathspitter bioforms;
                        a heavy unit that can fend in melee and ranged combat equally.

                    <p>
                        The silent Tyranid terror, extremely specialised assassins which hide in the shadows, awaiting for their prey to be at arms reach.
                        Giant Piercing Claws and an unseen Feeding Spike conform their arsenal.

                    <p>
                        Enormous Tyranid synaptic units, few in number and specialised, these juggernauts bore through rock and metal to open tunnels behind enemy lines.
                        Although not designed for battle, these beasts are unfaced by small Space Marine battalions, at least those that go unprepared…

                        A peaceful and tranquil haven under the banner of the Imperium not long ago, now swarming with an all-consuming legion of Tyranids.
                        What was a fruitful product of mankind is now a pulsating mass of matter to feast upon.

                        Strange rumbles and vibrations surround the interior of a decimated wonder of the Navis Imperialis, now transformed into the enemies’ nest.
                        Hidden dangers await in each corner, each shadow. Strangely, a pungent odor of decay comes from the captain’s quarters…
